# Commercial Check Ride Practice

Assume active runway is 32.

## Scenario 1

* Depart on runway heading
* Turn 90 to the left
* Climb to 2500' MSL on course until clear class D
* Practice diversion to alternate airport
* Calculate new remaining time en-route and fuel requirement

## Scenario 2

* Maintain current heading and altitude
* Verify HI, AI
* Landing configuration...
  * Slow down and maintain 80 KIAS
  * Slow down and maintain 70 KIAS
  * Slow down and maintain 60 KIAS
* Maintain minimum controllable speed (no stall horn)
  * Turn 90 degree to the left
  * Turn 90 degree to the right
* Power to idle
* Descent 500' while maintaining current airspeed of 60 KIAS
* Flare until stall and break at current altitude
* Recover
  * Full power
  * 1 notch of flap up
  * Positive rate of climb
  * Clean configuration
* Climb to power on stall
* Recover

## Scenario 3

* Maintain 3000' MSL
* Verify HI, AI
* Chandelle
  * Perform clearing turns if needed
  * Choose a ground reference
  * Enter 30 deg bank
  * Full throttle with 15 deg pitch up
  * At 90 deg, ease out the bank
  * NEVER LET IT STALL IN THE TURN
    * If stalling, decrease the pitch a bit
  * You can only stall at the very end when level
  * Hold the stall
  * Recover

Return to 3000' and repeat chandelle to the opposite direction.

## Scenario 4

* Maintain 3000' MSL
* Verify HI, AI
* Lazy Eight
  * Try without climb
  * Add climb
  * At 90 deg, highest altitude gain
  * Back to the same altitude when 180 reversal

## Scenario 5

* Maintain 3500' MSL
* Verify HI, AI
* Steep spiral
  * Clean configuration
  * Steep bank, 45-60
  * Trim for constant airspeed 80~90 KIAS
  * Use light touch aileron to maintain ground track
  * 3 turns
  * Enter and exit on the same heading

## Scenario 6

* Maintain 1100' MSL
* Verify HI, AI
* Eight on pylon
  * Don't start the turn until the pylon is on the wing

## Scenario 7

* Short landing with obstacle clearance
  * Specify spot to land
  * Add 100' to runway elevation
  * Clean 0.25 mile off the runway by that elevation
  * Use forward slip to come down
  * Full flaps
  * Spot landing
* Soft field landing
  * Touch and go
  * No specific spot needed
  * Relieve the pressure but not necessarily get the nose off the ground
  * Enter ground effect immediately after takeoff
  * Speed up to Vx
  * Climb at Vy
* 180 power off
  * Spot landing
  * Use forward slip
* Short approach
  * Spot landing
  * Use forward slip
