# Aircraft Ownership

* [Savvy: Buy or Walk Away](https://youtu.be/ObLZRNZcS1E)
  * High time is a plus (ideally 3/4 of the TBO)
  * Overhaul has direct reflection in sale price
  * Cosmetic issues have direct reflection in sale price
  * Avionics do not have direct reflection in sale price
  * Better to get a plane with good auto-pilot, and avionics
  * Better to get one 3/4 of the way through engine time and go beyond TBO
  * Better to get one with cosmetic, interior or exterior deficit and paint or redo interior based on your liking
  * Airframe high time is not good
  * Airframe too low time is not good
  * Average 100 hr/year is good
  * Aircraft sitting idle for too long is not good
  * Don't pay premium for ultra-low-time airframe
  * Avoid aircraft from regions of high corrosion risk: Florida, Texas,...
  * Avoid project aircraft or one with high-ticket refurbishment, other than engine OH
  * Missing log books can bring down sale values 20%-30%
  * Process:
    * Search to find your aircraft
    * Research it
    * Put an offer
    * Condition based purchase agreement
    * Perform pre-buy (be prepared to walk away)
    * Pre-buy comes back with some issues
    * Negotiate
