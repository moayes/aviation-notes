### Turbo Upgrade

**2022-04-22**: Got a quote from Tornado Alley for my 1997 Bonanza A36 already has IO-550 coming up on TBO....I appreciate any feedback on the pricing on if I should move forward with it.
Regarding replacing the engine rather overhauling prior to TN conversion....I think my pricing should be comparable to a factory new engine and the “GAMISPEC 550” is a demonstrably better engine, with a better warranty, that should perform better, run smoother and be more reliable over the long term. I think my quotation is fairly detailed regarding the engine build details and special treatments included which are unavailable in a factory engine or most other shop overhauls. There is also a lot that we do on the “Firewall Forward Treatment” with respect to new and overhauled parts replacement as well. There are actually some savings associated with our building up the new GAMISPEC 550 as a TN’d engine parts-wise and some labor savings in doing the engine change and TN installation concurrently. If you have a competitive quote, I’d be happy to review it for an “apples to apples” comparison. Likely, it boils down to “you get what you pay for” and we do offer a premium product.
Pricing Includes engine replacement with firewall forward treatment, new JPI EDM 930-6C engine monitor, CIES fuel senders, 6 place oxygen system, whirlwind system III, Osborne tip tanks with led lights. Removal of certain analog gauges since new engine monitor will be installed.
Pricing (not including a few other options available)...$183,960.

Pricing sounds right . 90,000+50,000+10,000, +20,000 plus the Eng monitoring stuff.

### Rust

Signs of rust and internal corrosion under the paint. This makes the airplane un-airworthy. These pictures are from a Bonanze. It's possible to get a new set of skins from Textron. At this time (April 2022) they’re about 20K with shipping and can take four or five months. Filiform corrosion or painted over at the previous shop. Looks like some rivet heads are threatening to pull through the skin as well- not a good sign.

### Paint

#### Paint Stripper

* [Lewis Law Aero Clean Technologies](https://www.aerocleantechnologies.com)
  * PS-3010 Neutral Peroxide Activated Paint Remover
  * AC-2010 Alkaline Water Based Cleaner
  * You need both of these since one is the deactivator of the striper after it was power washed off the plane. [Here is the list of supply's needed to do a paint job](/images/279481274_5482197065134272_3948434769346099040_n.jpg).
