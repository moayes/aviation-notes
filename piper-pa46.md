* [Buying A Used Aircraft: Piper PA-46 Malibu/Mirage/Matrix](https://www.avweb.com/used-aircraft-guide-digest/buying-a-used-aircraft-piper-pa-46-malibu-mirage-matrix)
  * First came Malibu
    * PA-46-310
    * Business-airplane styling, stands tall, a 43-foot wingspan, air stair cabin entry
    * Started in 1984
    * With 310-HP Continental TSIO-520
  * Then came Malibu Mirage
    * 1989
    * Twin-turbo, twin-intercooled Lycoming TIO-540-AE2A of 350 HP
    * Engine weighed 113 pounds more
    * Maximum takeoff weight was boosted by 200 pounds
    * The hydraulic system and cabin door were improved
    * Engine cooling system was redesigned
    * Seats were strengthened and
    * Flaps were changed from hydraulic to electric operation
    * Plus some big-airplane-type features, including:
      * a dual-bus electrical system
      * internal windshield deice
      * standard dual alternators and vacuum pumps
      * an auxiliary heater for the cabin
    * Later Mirage eventually got Garmin’s G1000 integrated avionics to replace Avidyne’s Entegra suite, and Garmin’s GFC 700 integrated autopilot.
      * Some came with S-TEC 55 autopilots
      * Earlier airplanes have BendixKing equipment, including the KFC200 autopilot
  * Early Mirages dealt with Lycoming’s massive crankshaft recall of 2002 and 2003 -- months of downtime.
    * Good glider thanks to long wings
    * 21% were engine-related accidents
  * Newer models are M-series

Malibu pilots report cruise speeds of 205 knots TAS as FL220 at 67 percent power and 210 knots true at FL250 at 75 percent. 
Mirage pilots may pay more at the gas pump, they also are able to go a little faster, with typical speeds in the 220-knot range at FL230-250 at 75 percent power burning 18.8 GPH.
Matrix is pretty much a Mirage without a pressurized cabin. To go high, you’ll need nose hoses and O2, but the tradeoff is slightly less maintenance and operational simplicity, although later Garmin G1000 models handle the cabin pressurization/environmental chores.

They all can fly 1100-nautical-mile trips with IFR reserves.
Control forces are somewhat heavy, and the airplane doesn’t exactly leap off the runway.
Once the speed builds in flight, the controls are responsive, with pitch the lightest and roll the heaviest
It's an autopilot airplane, and that’s really how it should be flown.

Wreck reports show that many PA-46 accidents occur during landing.
The long wing encourages floating and when lightly loaded, the CG is forward. The key is to slow it early (some have speedbrakes) and nail the speeds into the flare.

Caring for a PA-46 can be intense:

* alternators
* vacuum pumps
* exhaust system

Older models may have pressurization and air conditioning issues.

Malibu is not an airplane that just any shop can fix.
Highly recommended to use a shop with PA-46 experience.
