## It's Baffling

### Early design

* Engines were mounted with their finned cylendats out in the slipstream.
* Cooled by the horizontal flow of ram air.
* a.k.a verlocity cooling.
* Works well for single-row radial engines.
* Introduces additional drag.
* Doesn't work well with there are multiple rows (rows in the back get less cooling air).

### Newer design

* Pressure cooling.
* Cooling air intake in the front.
* Creates high pressure region on top of the engine (below cowling).
* Create low pressure region under the engine.
* Inter-cylinder baffles between cylinders so the cooling air is forced to go through fins.
* The cooling airflow is a function of pressure difference (delta-p).
* Delta-p is remarkably small (6-7 inches of water, about 1/4 PSI).
* Aircraft designers try to keep the delta to absolute minimum; higher delta increases cooling drag.
* Cowl flaps help to decrease the lowe pressure region.

### Troubleshooting

* Even a small leak in the system and seals causes the cooling air to escape and hence higher cylinder temperatures
* Inspect rubbing marks against where the seals are between the two (high and low pressure) regions
* There are also flexible seals that must be curved up, toward the high-P.
* Look for wrinkles and creases
* Look for missing, misaligned, or improperly installed intercylinder baffles
* Continental IO-550, a 6 cylinder in Cirrus, for example, has 4 intercylinder baffles, and they are not the identical, even though they may look similar. They have different part numbers. If they are installed improperly, they introduce leak.
* Remove the cowling, put the airplane in a dark hanger, put a bright shop light under the engine, climb a ladder and look straight from the top of the engine. You shouldn't see any light coming through.
* Rigid baffles are subject to cracking due to engine vibration and corrosion. Baffles are usually made of aluminium.
* Certified aircraft don't have composite baffles yet.
* The rubber seals made of silicons are very good.

## Leaning Basics

### Taught Wrong

* Student pilot is too busy to lean
* A lot of maneuvers
* Low altitude (less than 3k MSL)
* CFI reluctant to distract
* Law of primacy kicks in
* Fuel is cheaper than engine

### War Story
Embry Riddle, winter 1998-1999, operates the world's largest trainer
Replacing C150 C172R and S Lycoming IO-360-L2A
- standard instrumentation
- no fancy engine monitor
- fixed pitch
- don't touch the red knob below 5k MSL
- Florida is at sea level, so nobody touching
- Ended with rough engines, fouling spark plugs, etc. Grounded a large portion.
- Lycoming got involved: running too rich
- POH didn't have any instruction on leaning
- Lycoming Service Instruction #1497 & #1497A; later incorporated into POH
    - Minimum prime for start
    - Lean to max RPM for ground op upto runup
    - Lean during climb to 3k MSL
    - Lean at cruise at all altitudes
    - Very radical departure from previous practices

Full rich:

- start on cold engine
- max power operation, i.e. takeoff at density altitude below 3000'
- only for 1-2 minutes at most
- operate very occasionally
- runup also lean to best power mixture = max RPM
- takeoff from high-altitude or climb in cruise above 3000' lean to max RPM
- lean to the onset of engine roughness then rich to smooth (without the engine complaining)

Why full rich is too rich?

1. Need a abnormally (super) rich mixture when engine is cold. think of lawn mowers, (antique) cars with choke
2. Unlike other engines, we run at 100% power particularly at 100% power, you need "adequate denotation margin"

Analogy: drop a burning match in a pail of gasoline. The match goes out. Too rich to burn, i.e. flooded.
Saturate a rag and drop a burning match on the rag. Molotov Cocktail: ugly burning, smoke...
How do you make the rag burn hotter and get rid of smoke? Blow air = fanning the flame, i.e. leaning the mixture.
But, you need to turn on the fan _after_ burning the rag not before. So you need the extra rich at the beginning then lean it.

- >1:8 fuel:air too rich

    - 1:16 best economy mixture
    - 1:15 Stoichiometric mixture
    - 1:12.5 best power mixture (maximum horsepower, max RPM, CO high)
