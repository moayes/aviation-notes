## It's Baffling

### Early design

* Engines were mounted with their finned cylendats out in the slipstream.
* Cooled by the horizontal flow of ram air.
* a.k.a verlocity cooling.
* Works well for single-row radial engines.
* Introduces additional drag.
* Doesn't work well with there are multiple rows (rows in the back get less cooling air).

### Newer design

* Pressure cooling.
* Cooling air intake in the front.
* Creates high pressure region on top of the engine (below cowling).
* Create low pressure region under the engine.
* Inter-cylinder baffles between cylinders so the cooling air is forced to go through fins.
* The cooling airflow is a function of pressure difference (delta-p).
* Delta-p is remarkably small (6-7 inches of water, about 1/4 PSI).
* Aircraft designers try to keep the delta to absolute minimum; higher delta increases cooling drag.
* Cowl flaps help to decrease the lowe pressure region.

### Troubleshooting

* Even a small leak in the system and seals causes the cooling air to escape and hence higher cylinder temperatures
* Inspect rubbing marks against where the seals are between the two (high and low pressure) regions
* There are also flexible seals that must be curved up, toward the high-P.
* Look for wrinkles and creases
* Look for missing, misaligned, or improperly installed intercylinder baffles
* Continental IO-550, a 6 cylinder in Cirrus, for example, has 4 intercylinder baffles, and they are not the identical, even though they may look similar. They have different part numbers. If they are installed improperly, they introduce leak.
* Remove the cowling, put the airplane in a dark hanger, put a bright shop light under the engine, climb a ladder and look straight from the top of the engine. You shouldn't see any light coming through.
* Rigid baffles are subject to cracking due to engine vibration and corrosion. Baffles are usually made of aluminium.
* Certified aircraft don't have composite baffles yet.
* The rubber seals made of silicons are very good.
