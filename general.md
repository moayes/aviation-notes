## Maintenance

* [Sludge: Why change oil?](https://blog.aopa.org/aopa/tag/sludge/)
  * oil change every 50 hours or 4-6 months, whichever comes first;
  * if using oil screen instead of full-flow oil filter, change every 25 hours.

* CHT too hot or too cold?
  * Lycoming usually run 20 degrees hotter than Continental, because of the alloys used in them
  * Decrease max sweet spot numbers by 20 for below ISA, or efficient cooling system, e.g. Cirrus, Columbia, Diamond.
  * Increase max sweet spot during engine break-in but never exceed manufacturer's red line
    * Max Lycoming 500
    * Max Continental 480
  * Sweet spot for Lycoming 350-400
  * Sweet spot for Continental 330-380
  * Below recommended minimums, lead deposition and more harm to engine.
  * 3 main reasons engine running too hot:
      1. Mixture too lean
          * Test flight with ROP and LOP.
          * The problematic cylinder should be cooler-than-normal ROP, and hotter-than-normal LOP.
      2. Not enough cooling air
          * Hotter in both LOP and ROP.
      3. Advanced ignition timing
          * All cylinder will be hotter-than-normal.

## Insurance Tips

* Engine failure is usually not covered by insurance. It's considered wear and tear.
  * However, if, for example, oil hose is ruptured in-flight, and as a result the engine seized operation because of oil starvation, you can argue that the oil hose is not part of the engine but rather part of the airframe and engine failure was a consequential result of the airframe failure, therefore engineer failure in this should be covered by insurance.
    * Likewise, if engine fails initially in-flight, e.g. a cylinder fails, the consequential damage to the airframe because of a forced landing is covered by the insurance.
* In a turbo-charged aircraft, the turbo-charge equipment is part of airframe, not the engine.
