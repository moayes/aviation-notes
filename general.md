## Maintenance

* [Sludge: Why change oil?](https://blog.aopa.org/aopa/tag/sludge/)
  * oil change every 50 hours or 4-6 months, whichever comes first;
  * if using oil screen instead of full-flow oil filter, change every 25 hours.
* [Camshaft vs Crankshaft: What Is the Difference?](https://www.familyhandyman.com/article/camshaft-vs-crankshaft/)
* CHT too hot or too cold?
  * Lycoming usually run 20 degrees hotter than Continental, because of the alloys used in them
  * Decrease max sweet spot numbers by 20 for below ISA, or efficient cooling system, e.g. Cirrus, Columbia, Diamond.
  * Increase max sweet spot during engine break-in but never exceed manufacturer's red line
    * Max Lycoming 500
    * Max Continental 480
  * Sweet spot for Lycoming 350-400
  * Sweet spot for Continental 330-380
  * Below recommended minimums, lead deposition and more harm to engine.
  * 3 main reasons engine running too hot:
      1. Mixture too lean
          * Test flight with ROP and LOP.
          * The problematic cylinder should be cooler-than-normal ROP, and hotter-than-normal LOP.
      2. Not enough cooling air
          * Hotter in both LOP and ROP.
      3. Advanced ignition timing
          * All cylinder will be hotter-than-normal.
