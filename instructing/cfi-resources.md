## Common Problem

### General pilot skills

* Staring too much at the cockpit instruments for a VFR flight
* Bad taxi skills
* Death grip on the flight controls
* Collision avoidance:  Failure to look before turning & failure to clear the pattern (both * sides) before using the runway
* Failure to hold heading, altitude, airspeed, etc.

### Pattern

* Failure to maintain an appropriate ground track, compensating for winds
* Failure to maintain a straight departure leg, compensating for winds
* Failure to employ collision avoidance techniques
* Slipping the wrong way (should be wing down into the wind)
* What frequency to use when the tower is closed
* "...commence turn to crosswind leg beyond the departure end of the runway within 300 feet of pattern altitude." -- AIM 4-3-3

### Airwork

* Stall recovery, folks still shove the nose over and point the aircraft at the ground.
* Stall recovery is always PITCH-POWER-DRAG-CLIMB. The initial reaction is alter the pitch to alleviate the stall - this is usually putting the nose to the horizon or slightly below it.

### Emergency Procedures

* Failure to click off autopilot when an engine failure has occurred
* Spin recovery checklist

### Cross Country Flight Planning

* Failure to know what airspace you'll be flying through for each part of your cross country including weather minimums
* Failure to do a weight and balance
* Can you do a diversion by ded(uctive) reckoning?  Over-reliance on GPS or VOR equipment.

### Regulatory

* Unable to show ARROW
* Unable to show AV1ATE + Airworthiness Directive Compliance
* Unable to discuss the required equipment of 91.205 and 91.213
