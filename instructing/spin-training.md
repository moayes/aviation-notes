# Spin Training

## General

* Two critical moments:
  * Turn base to final
  * Upwind of the takeoff
* Don't cheat with inside rudder
* Spin recovery: opposite rudder of direction of turn

Lift <-> Weight
Lift/Weight = G in cockpit
Weight/Weight = 1G

Elevator bends the flight path.
Ailerons are merely bank angles.

Awareness
Action      | Consequence | Prevention         | Recovery
Pull        | Stall       | Relax + trim       | Push
Pull + yaw  | Spin        | Relax + coordinate | PARE
Bank + yank | Spiral      | Relax + shallow    | Power + push + roll

Rote: the horizontal component of lift turns the airplane.
Understanding: it's about manipulating the magnitude and direction of lift.
Application: must apply the elevator correctly for the desired performance.
Correlation: bend or straighten the flight path with elevator inputs.

## Slipping and Skidding Turns

When you push the rudder, the nose goes to the direction of the rudder. But the tail goes the opposite site. The effect is that the wing on the rudder side, moves back, the opposite wing moves forward. The wing that moved back is now going slower. So if there's a stall-spin, it's toward the wing that moved back.

In slipping turn, too much rudder on the opposite side, causes the wing that's traveling outside the turn to stall and roll. So it's less of an issue.

In skidding turn, too much rudder causes the wing inside the turn to stall and spin.

For practice, go into a slip and try to stall.

**To start a slip, always add aileron first, then rudder.** Otherwise, you'll be skidding because the nose goes to the opposite direction first, then the wing wants to bring it back but it can't. The turn of the nose because of the rudder input has a greater displacement than the aileron.
