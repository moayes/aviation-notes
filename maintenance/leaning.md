## Leaning Basics

[Video](https://youtu.be/_VfiPuheeGw)

### Taught Wrong

* Student pilot is too busy to lean
* A lot of maneuvers
* Low altitude (less than 3k MSL)
* CFI reluctant to distract
* Law of primacy kicks in
* Fuel is cheaper than engine

### War Story

Embry-Riddle, winter 1998-1999, operates the world's largest trainer
Replacing C150, C172 R and S Lycoming IO-360-L2A:

* Standard instrumentation
* no fancy engine monitor
* fixed pitch
* don't touch the red knob below 5k MSL
* Florida is at sea level, so nobody touching
* Ended with rough engines, fouling spark plugs, etc. Grounded a large portion.
* Lycoming got involved: running too rich
* POH didn't have any instruction on leaning
* Lycoming Service Instruction #1497 & #1497A; later incorporated into POH
  * Minimum prime for start
  * Lean to max RPM for ground op upto run-up
  * Lean during climb to 3k MSL
  * Lean at cruise at all altitudes
  * Very radical departure from previous practices

Full rich:

* start on cold engine
* max power operation, i.e. takeoff at density altitude below 3000'
* only for 1-2 minutes at most
* operate very occasionally
* run-up also lean to best power mixture = max RPM
* takeoff from high-altitude or climb in cruise above 3000' lean to max RPM
* lean to the onset of engine roughness then rich to smooth (without the engine complaining)

Why full rich is too rich?

1. Need a abnormally (super) rich mixture when engine is cold. think of lawn mowers, (antique) cars with choke
2. Unlike other engines, we run at 100% power particularly at 100% power, you need "adequate denotation margin"

Analogy: drop a burning match in a pail of gasoline. The match goes out. Too rich to burn, i.e. flooded.
Saturate a rag and drop a burning match on the rag. Molotov Cocktail: ugly burning, smoke...
How do you make the rag burn hotter and get rid of smoke? Blow air = fanning the flame, i.e. leaning the mixture.
But, you need to turn on the fan _after_ burning the rag not before. So you need the extra rich at the beginning then lean it.
Pratt & Whitney radial engine combustion curve diagram to show the envelop.

* Less than 1:18 fuel:air too lean
* More than 1:8 fuel:air too rich
* in this envelop:
  * 1:16 best economy mixture
    * minimum exhaust
    * all moderns cars operate in this regime because of environmental concerns
    * about 90% of power
    * about 20% less fuel
    * less of 10% power
    * less of 5% TAS
    * 30F ~ 70F LoP
    * in carbureted engine you may not get here because usually the engine runs rough
  * 1:15 Stoichiometric mixture
    * chemically perfect ratio
    * about 97% of power
    * no excess fuel or oxygen is left
    * a.k.a peak EGT
  * 1:12.5 best power mixture
    * on the rich side
    * uses about 20% more fuel than stoichiometric point
    * outputs about 3% more power
    * airspeed varies with square root of power
    * about 1.5% TAS
    * maximum horsepower
    * max RPM
    * higher CO and other exhaust
    * no reason to fly at this regime
    * 70F ~ 100F RoP

### Rich of Peak (RoP) vs. Lean of Peak (LoP)

RoP means operate our engines with the fuel flows on the rich side of peak exhaust gas temperature (EGT):

* lean the fuel flows to peak EGT and
* then enrichen a certain number of degrees (normally 50°F on the rich side).

LoP means

* leaning it until you get peak EGT and
* then continuing the leaning process to a certain number of degrees lean of peak EGT (the number of degrees would depend on how you wish to run the engine – the higher the power output the more you would lean).
