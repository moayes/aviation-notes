# Fuel Air Mixture

## Notes

## Techniques

### Hot start

Hot starting is not actually a problem right after shutdown.
It's a problem maybe some 20 minutes after the shutdown, when the heat had a chance to sink in.

* Open cowling if you can to let the heat out.
* Open a fuel filler door on the top of the cowling
* If you have cowl flaps and a choice how to park, put the tail toward the wind, basically opposite of how you'd fly into the wind so the wind blows into the cowl flaps and flushes the heat out.
* With Continentals, you can put the mixture on idle cutoff, full throttle, run boost pump on high for half a minute. It will run cold fuel from the tanks to the fuel control units, but it won't reach the engine, because the mixture is cut off, so it won't flood the engine. All the pumped fuel will return back to the tank. This will cool down the system and purges most of the warm fuel and vapors out of the system. Then give it a small blip with the mixture and then turn the engine.

### Cleaning fuel injection nozzles

If you have digital engine monitor, don't do it unless you see something on the monitor that tells you you're running a cylinder too lean.

There's a coarse filter right after the tank when the fuel comes out, there's a gascolator right before fuel control and there's fine filter before the nozzle.

Any small particle in the fuel is going to be caught in those filters. There's more risk in opening the fuel system, and introducing foreign objects to it that would end up blocking fuel nozzle than keep the system closed and uncontaminated.
