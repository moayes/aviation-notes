# Tires

Aircraft tires are made of natural rubber.
Whereas, automobile tires are use synthetic compounds extensively.
Aircraft tires need to be able to flex as much as 3x the rate of an automotive tire during normal operation, especially landings.

## Inflation

Maintaining proper inflation, no matter how hard.
It is not possible to eyeball a tire and determine it is inflated to the proper pressure.

Most aircraft tubes are still made from natural rubber.
Air slowly diffuses through the rubber.
This diffusion is normal but requires that the tire be checked and serviced every few days.
The normal daily pressure loss is ~2%.
If this leakage exceeds 5%, the tire/tube should be removed from service and investigated.

The best medium for servicing aircraft tires is nitrogen.
Clean, dry air can be used too.
Oxygen should be less than 5%.

* Higher oxygen content, excessive heat build up resulting from hot brakes, a locked wheel, etc., can result in an explosion when mixed with the hydrocarbons from the heated tire.
* Excessive water vapor can condense and freeze at altitude. 
* Unfiltered compressors may pass air containing lubricating oil, which can deteriorate the natural rubber in the tire and tube.
