## Notes

### Weight and Balance

* **Basic Empty Weight (GAMA)**: the standard empty weight plus the weight of optional and special equipment that have been installed.
* **Standard Empty Weight (GAMA)**: aircraft weight that consists of the airframe, engines, and all items of operating equipment that have fixed locations and are permanently installed in the aircraft, including fixed ballast, hydraulic fluid, unusable fuel, and full engine oil.
* **Licensed Empty Weight (Pre-GAMA)**: the empty weight that consists of the airframe, engine(s), unusable fuel, and un-drain-able oil plus standard and optional equipment as specified in the equipment list. Some manufacturers used this term prior to GAMA standardization.
* **Payload (GAMA)**: the weight of occupants, cargo, and baggage.
* **Useful Load**: the weight of the pilot, copilot, passengers, baggage, usable fuel, and drain-able oil. It is the basic empty weight subtracted from the maximum allowable gross weight. This term applies to general aviation (GA) aircraft only.

### Entering a holding pattern

* Doing it on the map:

  * Locate the fix (or simply draw a fix on a paper)
  * Draw N-S and E-W lines
  * Draw a line 290-110.
    * This creates a 70° segment in NW, 110° NE-SE and 180° W-SW.
  * Use **direct** entry if entering the fix anywhere in the 180° (W-SW) segment.
  * Use **parallel** entry if entering the fix anywhere in the 110° (NE-SE) segment.
  * Use **tear drop** entry if entering the fix anywhere in the 70° (NW) segment.

On the map, the _standard_ pattern is right hand, keep _right hand down_.
For non-standard, keep the right hand up!

* Doing it on the HI (heading indicator):

  * Assume the airplane is the fix.
  * Draw up-down line (extend the heading upward and downward).
  * Draw a line that make 70° on the right, 110° to the left.
    * This is the opposite of the map; keep the _right hand (standard) up_!
  * Draw the inbound line, from the center outward
  * Use **direct** entry if the inbound leg is in the 180° segment.
  * Use **parallel** entry if the inbound leg is in the 110° segment.
  * Use **tear drop** entry if the inbound leg is in the 70° segment.

On the HI, the _standard_ pattern is right hand _up_.
For non-standard, keep the right hand down!

* [IFR in Class G](https://www.ifr-magazine.com/charts-plates/on-your-own-in-class-g/)
  * An appropriately rated, current pilot, in an appropriately equipped aircraft, may fly IFR in class G airspace without either a clearance or a flight plan.
  * When class G is overlaid by controlled airspace, like class E, the pilot will need a clearance before entering controlled airspace.
* [IFR Recency](https://pilot-protection-services.aopa.org/news/2020/march/01/instrument-currency)
  * Part 61, within the preceding 6 calendar months from the month of the flight, log and perform
  * 6 instrument approaches, holding procedures and tasks, and intercepting and tracking courses
  * through the use of navigational electronic systems

* [VOR deflection](https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2014/april/01/ifr-fix-a-full-scale-deflection)
  * @ 60NM, full deflection is 12 degrees
  * In 5-dot VOR, 1 dot becomes 2.4NM off course
  * @ 30NM, 1 dot, 1NM off course
