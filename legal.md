# Legal Notes

* [Owning is operating](https://pilot-protection-services.aopa.org/news/2022/may/01/owning-is-operating)
  * Be wary whom you permit to use your aircraft, because owning is presumed to be operating. If the pilot violates any FARs and you do not play ball with the FAA, you could be on the hook, and the sanction you face could be more than $14,000 for each violation depending on the type and severity.
