## Insurance Tips

* Engine failure is usually not covered by insurance. It's considered wear and tear.
  * However, if, for example, oil hose is ruptured in-flight, and as a result the engine seized operation because of oil starvation, you can argue that the oil hose is not part of the engine but rather part of the airframe and engine failure was a consequential result of the airframe failure, therefore engineer failure in this should be covered by insurance.
    * Likewise, if engine fails initially in-flight, e.g. a cylinder fails, the consequential damage to the airframe because of a forced landing is covered by the insurance.
* In a turbo-charged aircraft, the turbo-charge equipment is part of airframe, not the engine.
